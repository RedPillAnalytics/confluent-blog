# Quickstart for the gradle-confluent Plugin
This repository is a companion to a yet-to-be-published series on using Gradle with KSQL and Kafka Streams.

The plugin used by this repository is available from the [Gradle Plugin Portal](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.redpillanalytics.gradle-confluent). You can explore the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/RedPillAnalytics/confluent-blog) that hosts the plugin and open feature requests, and maybe even contribute pull requests. Finally, the CI process for the plugin publishes the latest [API documentation](https://s3.amazonaws.com/documentation.redpillanalytics.com/gradle-confluent/latest/index.html) which might also be helpful

Since most of what is contained here is Gradle-based, I also decided to use the wonderful [Gradle Docker Compose Plugin](https://github.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin) to manage the environment necessary for this quickstart. I borrowed and modified the 
[docker compose file](docker-compose.yml) file from the [Confluent Clickstream Example](https://github.com/confluentinc/examples/tree/5.1.0-post/clickstream), so many thanks to [Robin Moffatt of Confluent](https://twitter.com/rmoff) for this.

To get the Confluent and KSQL environment necessary for this Quickstart, just do the following:

```Bash
==> ./gradlew composeUp

> Task :composeUp
zookeeper uses an image, skipping
kafka uses an image, skipping
schema-registry uses an image, skipping
kafka-connect uses an image, skipping
ksql-server uses an image, skipping
ksql-cli uses an image, skipping
kafkacat uses an image, skipping
datagen uses an image, skipping

You can verify that the three clickstream tables necessary for the Quickstart are there using the KSQL CLI:

```Bash
==> ksql
